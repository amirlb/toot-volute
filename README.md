# Toot Volute

Following an idea of Luci for Chai Tea, Toot Volute is a way to embed code
in toots - posts in the Mastodon network.

![A toot from 11/13/2022, saying: 
some people thought it was a bad idea to put a scripting language in a toot.
but the tootapp ecosystem is amazing. sudoku and wordle games? pitfall? zomg

This is definitely a bad idea, which you can now [try out here, on the Toot Volute interpreter](https://amirlb.github.io/toot-volute/)!

## Language Definition

This is still changing rapidly, see the [examples directory](examples/) for examples.
